# Product Spec Design: easyA
The easyA app will allow Purdue Students to create and read reviews about their courses. This will allow students to get an impression of what their peers think of a specific course. This will help students choose which classes to take and even have a better idea of their majors in the future. easyA aims to reduce the uncertainty of students trying to choose majors or tracks inside a specific major.
